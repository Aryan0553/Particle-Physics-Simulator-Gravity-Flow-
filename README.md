# Particle Physics Simulation 🎆

An interactive particle physics simulation developed in Python using Tkinter. 
This project visualizes real-time particle motion with gravity, collisions, fading effects, and user-driven interactions, showcasing core concepts of physics-based animation and GUI programming.


## 🚀 Features

- Real-time particle movement with smooth animation
- Gravity points that attract particles dynamically
- Collision handling with walls and energy loss
- Particle lifespan with fade-out effects
- Mouse and keyboard interactivity
- Optimized update loop targeting ~60 FPS
